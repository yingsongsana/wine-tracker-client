# Wine Journal Application

This is part of a full-stack project utilizing Rails to create API as well as the
front-end here utilizing Javascript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, and Handlebars.
Within this application, user is able to sign-up and create an account. Once signed-in,
user is able to create new journal entries for each wine they'd like to have a record of.
Aside from creating, they are also able to update, delete, and view each entry of
their choosing. All the entries are stored using the corresponding API built on Rails.

### Process and planning

For this project, I worked with simple user stories and wireframes. The wireframes
have since changed from its original conception. A lot of the workflow is modeled
after the previous front-end project I recently completed. A lot less syntax error
this time around. Still plenty of bugs but I was able to use the error messages
more to my use. I find that I'm able to articulate the underlying programming
concepts more this time around. The issue queue was much easier to use because I knew
how to better communicate my problems.

### Items to work on for future iterations
..* Styling: more user-friendly interface once signed in. A better display of wine entries.
..* Navbar functionality: change password component in a dropdown item or a modal.
..* Better and more semantically-minded html elements.
..* User success/fail messages should disappear after an amount of time.
